<h1>Project Proposal<h1>


<h3>Domain of interest</h3>

**_Why are you interested in this field/domain?_**
 Mass Incarceration is a huge problem in the United States. The rate of mass incarceration is historically very high and we want to use data to show how structural racism has a huge impact in the prison system.

 **_What other examples of data driven projects have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)?_**
 <ol>
 <li> [The Sentencing Project](https://www.sentencingproject.org/issues/incarceration/) </li>
 <li>[The Marshal Project](https://www.themarshallproject.org/records/617-mass-incarceration)</li>

**_What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)?_**

 A couple of data driven questions that we came up with as a group are:
<ol>

<li> Does skin color affect the rate of imprisonment? Colorism?</li>

<li>What is the proportion of incarceration by different races?</li>  

<li>Do certain states have higher incarceration rates than other states? Is it significant?</li>

<ol>


<h3>Finding Data</h3>

**_Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?_**

**_How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about_**

<ol>
<li> The data was collected by ‘identifying how many of the more than 70 million people with criminal records have become involved with the criminal justice system in each of three discrete ways: through imprisonment, conviction of a felony without subsequent imprisonment, and conviction of a misdemeanor’ -Brennan Center</li>
<li> The data is collected by stating facts about how the modern day prison system and policing is affected by the aftermath of slavery and Reconstruction era of 1863-1877. ( The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)) </li>
<li>This data was generated by showing how systemic racism is a driven force of the prison system. Data is shown as charts. Data is collected by The Bureau of Justice Statistics and written by Wendy Sawyer.  </li>

**How many observations (rows) are in your data?**
There are many rows because there are many datasets, we estimated there to be approx. (10+)

**How many features (columns) are in the data?**
We also believe that there are also many columns because there are multiple datasets, and we also estimated there to be approx. (10+)

**What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?**


- What is the proportion of incarceration by different races?

- Do certain states have higher incarceration rates than other states? Is it significant?

- How has slavery and Jim Crow played in the making of policies for mass incarcerations?
- How are poor communities impacted?
- Has the economy been affected in any way?
- What role does the education system play in with mass incarceration?
