Introductory Paragraph

Mass incarceration is an astronomical problem in the United States. The U.S. leads with the highest incarceration rate of any country in the world. Not really something that should be celebrated. Research has shown that it is mainly African-Americans that inhabit these prisons/jails. Is there a societal problem? Can we expose this great injustice to the individuals that, one could say, built this country? Letâ€™s find out!    

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
